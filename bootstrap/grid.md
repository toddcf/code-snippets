# Bootstrap Grid

See Bootstrap's official documentation for full explanation.

## Column Sizes

- Large (col-lg)
  - Full-size computer screens.
- Medium (col-md)
  - Laptops or smaller computer screens.
- Small (col-sm)
  - Tablets
- Extra Small (col-xs)
  - Mobile devices
  - Most sites have their content stack when on a mobile device.

The column size you choose tells Bootstrap which breakpoint you want to affect your layout.

You can put more than one column size class on the same div. For example, the same div could be `class="col-lg-1 col-md-2"`, which means when it's in the LARGE screen width, that div has the width of ONE column -- and if it's in the MEDIUM screen width, that div changes to have the width of TWO columns.
