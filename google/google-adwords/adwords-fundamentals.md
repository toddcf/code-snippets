# AdWords Fundamentals

Ads should be clear, relevant, and include a link to your website.

## Types of Ads

- Text ads
- Image ads
- Video ads

## Google Network

The Google Network is made up of two networks:

1. Search
2. Display

These are the places your AdWords ads can appear, including: 

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)
- Google partner sites
- Mobile phone apps

### Google Search Network

Makes it easy for people to *search* for you on Google.

Set up your campaign to include certain search keywords (or phrases) people would type into Google, and your ads will display at the top of their search results.

Your Search Network ads can appear on:

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)

### Google Display Network

Allows you to *display* your ads in places that are likely to reach your target audience.

You can still target wide or narrow demographics.

Your Display Network ads can appear on:

### Text Ads

- Required:
  - Headline
  - URL
  - Description
- Optional:
  - Path Fields

#### Headline Tips

- People are most likely to notice the headline. Consider including at least one of your keywords in your headline.
- Two headline fields are available with up to 30 characters each.
- Consider how longer headlines might text wrap on smaller screens.

#### URL Details

If your final URL is www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants, only www.example.com will display. The rest will be in the Path fields.

#### Path Fields (optional)

There are two optional path fields, which can hold up to 15 characters each.

These come after your URL, and give the user an idea of what part of the site they'll be taken to -- but they are not the actual characters of the path.

For example, www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants might become www.example.com/Indoor-Plants.

#### Description Field

Up to 80 characters. Use to:

- Highlight unique details about your product or service.
- Include keywords that match probable search terms.

On mobile, where space is limited, AdWords optimizes your ads to show the highest-performing text.

#### Tips for Writing Effective Text Ads

Effective ads are:

- Specific
- Relevant
- Actionable

You should:

- Highlight what makes you unique.
- Use a CTA.
- Include sales terms. (Make sure customers know if there's a discount, sale, etc.)
- Include your keywords in the ad.
- Match your ad to your landing page. (Ensure your ad takes customers to the part of your site where they can act on it. Make the purchase easy for them.)
- Optimize your headlines. Headlines matter . . . a lot. They are the most likely thing your viewer will read. Also, keep in mind how the text will wrap on smaller screens.
- On mobile devices, use CTAs that engage mobile users particularly well.
- Use ad extensions. Including information below your ad, such as additional deep links into your website or business location, has been shown to increase your ad's performance.

#### Tips for Improving Landing Page Experience

The experience users have after they click your ad and visit your landing page URL is just as important as your ad itself. It affects:

- Ad Rank
- CPC (Cost per Click)
- Your position in the ad auction

A poor landing page experience can result in your ads showing less often -- or not at all. Here's how to avoid that:

- Offer relevant, useful, original content.
- Be specific. If a user clicks an ad for a specific sports car, they shouldn't be taken to a landing page for a variety of sports cars.
- Be general when the user wants more options, such as a comparision page of various camera models instead of one camera model.
- Be transparent about what your business does.
- Explain your products or services before asking users to fill out forms.
- Make it easy to find your contact info.
- If you request personal info from customers, be clear why you're asking for it and what you'll do with it.
- Distinguish sponsored links (like ads) from the rest of your website's content.
- Make mobile and desktop navigation easy.
- Avoid using pop-ups and other interferences.
- Show customers what they're looking for "above the fold."
- Make it quick and easy for customers to purchase whatever they saw in your ad.
- Keep landing page load times as fast as possible.
