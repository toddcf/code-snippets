# AdWords Fundamentals

Ads should be clear, relevant, and include a link to your website.

## Types of Ads

These are the places your AdWords ads can appear, including: 

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)

### Google Search Network

Makes it easy for people to *search* for you on Google.

Your Search Network ads can appear on:

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)
