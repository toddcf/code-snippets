# AdWords Fundamentals

[Test on: Dad's calendar, my books (am I allowed to use Amazon Associates links??), Piel Canela, Proofreader (book and cloud).]

Ads should be clear, relevant, and include a link to your website.

## Types of Ads

- Text ads
- Image ads
- Video ads

## Google Network

The Google Network is made up of two networks:

1. Search
2. Display

These are the places your AdWords ads can appear, including: 

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)
- Google partner sites
- Mobile phone apps

### Google Search Network

Makes it easy for people to *search* for you on Google.

Set up your campaign to include certain search keywords (or phrases) people would type into Google, and your ads will display at the top of their search results.

Your Search Network ads can appear on:

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)

### Google Display Network

Allows you to *display* your ads in places that are likely to reach your target audience.

You can still target wide or narrow demographics.

Your Display Network ads can appear on:

- YouTube
- Blogger
- Gmail
- Other Google sites
- Google partner sites

## Ad Formats

- Text Ads
  - Consists of a descriptive headline, URL, and descriptive text (such as a CTA).
  - Simplest type of AdWord ad.
  - Can Appear:
    - Search Network

  - Can Appear:
    - Display Network

### Text Ads

- Required:
  - Headline
  - URL
  - Description
- Optional:
  - Path Fields

#### Headline Tips

- People are most likely to notice the headline. Consider including at least one of your keywords in your headline.
- Two headline fields are available with up to 30 characters each.
- Consider how longer headlines might text wrap on smaller screens.

#### URL Details

If your final URL is www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants, only www.example.com will display. The rest will be in the Path fields.

#### Path Fields (optional)

There are two optional path fields, which can hold up to 15 characters each.

These come after your URL, and give the user an idea of what part of the site they'll be taken to -- but they are not the actual characters of the path.

For example, www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants might become www.example.com/Indoor-Plants.

#### Description Field

Up to 80 characters. Use to:

- Highlight unique details about your product or service.
- Include keywords that match probable search terms.

On mobile, where space is limited, AdWords optimizes your ads to show the highest-performing text.

#### Tips for Writing Effective Text Ads

Effective ads are:

- Specific
- Relevant
- Actionable

You should:

- Highlight what makes you unique.
- Use a CTA.
- Include sales terms. (Make sure customers know if there's a discount, sale, etc.)
- Include your keywords in the ad.
- Match your ad to your landing page. (Ensure your ad takes customers to the part of your site where they can act on it. Make the purchase easy for them.)
- Optimize your headlines. Headlines matter . . . a lot. They are the most likely thing your viewer will read. Also, keep in mind how the text will wrap on smaller screens.
- On mobile devices, use CTAs that engage mobile users particularly well.
- Use ad extensions. Including information below your ad, such as additional deep links into your website or business location, has been shown to increase your ad's performance.

#### Tips for Improving Landing Page Experience

The experience users have after they click your ad and visit your landing page URL is just as important as your ad itself. It affects:

- Ad Rank
- CPC (Cost per Click)
- Your position in the ad auction

A poor landing page experience can result in your ads showing less often -- or not at all. Here's how to avoid that:

- Offer relevant, useful, original content.
- Be specific. If a user clicks an ad for a specific sports car, they shouldn't be taken to a landing page for a variety of sports cars.
- Be general when the user wants more options, such as a comparision page of various camera models instead of one camera model.
- Be transparent about what your business does.
- Explain your products or services before asking users to fill out forms.
- Make it easy to find your contact info.
- If you request personal info from customers, be clear why you're asking for it and what you'll do with it.
- Distinguish sponsored links (like ads) from the rest of your website's content.
- Make mobile and desktop navigation easy.
- Avoid using pop-ups and other interferences.
- Show customers what they're looking for "above the fold."
- Make it quick and easy for customers to purchase whatever they saw in your ad.
- Keep landing page load times as fast as possible.

### Ad Extensions

Examples:

- Call buttons
- Location information
- Additional links
- Additional text

And more.

Benefits:

- The additional content gives your ad greater visibility and prominence on the search results page.
- Often gives you more value for your advertising investment.
  - Increases total number of clicks. (Average 10-15% increase for each type of extension implemented.)
  - Gives users interactive ways of contacting you.
- No cost to adding extensions.
  - Clicks on your ad are charged as usual. (You're charged when someone calls you from your call extension, or downloads your app from your app extension.)

There is no limit to the number of ad extensions you can add, but a maximum of four can show across an AdWords campaign at any given time.
  - Exception: Clicks on review extensions and seller ratings are not charged at all.

Specific Types of Extensions:

- Sitelinks. These display 6-8 additional links to specific pages on your site. (Store Hours, Locations, etc.)
- Callouts. Add additional text to your ad. ("Local flowers, Online ordering, Free delivery.")
- Structured Snippets. Highlight specific aspects of your products or services. These show underneath your ad as additional headers and lists. (Example: "Destinations," and "Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Africa".)
- Call Extensions. (Tap or click to call.)

AdWords even appends other extensions to your ads automatically when it predicts they will improve your performance.

In fact, none of your extensions display all the time. They are shown or hidden depending on AdWords' prediction of performance.

Also, you need to hit a minimum Ad Rank for any of your extensions to display at all. (More on this later.)

#### Deciding Which Ad Extensions to Use

 Because AdWords selects which extensions to hide or display based on each individual Google search, it makes sense to make use of all the extensions relevant to your business goals. Here are recommendations based on your goals:

- All Businesses
  - Sitelink Extensions
  - Callout Extensions
  - Structured Snippets
- Get customers to buy from your business locations.
  - Location extensions. (Location, call button, and a link to your business details page (hours, photos, directions).)
- Get customers to contact you.
  - Call extensions
  - Message extensions (text messaging). Can be added globally at the campaign level, or at ad group levels.
- Get customers to convert on your website.
  - Price Extensions. Allow customers to browse your products right in your ad, showing categories and prices.
  - Promotion extensions. Show specific sales and promotions across your ads. (30% off roses, etc.)
- Get people to download your app.
  - App extensions

## Campaign Types

- Search Network campaign
  - Appear near Google search results when people search for relevant keywords. Shows your ad to high-potential customers right when they're searching for related products or services.
  - Drives traffic to your site. Can also be used in tandem with other campaign types. 
- Display Network campaign
  - Ads appear throughout the Google Display Network, matching them to websites or mobile apps that contain content related to your business or to your customers' interests.
  - You can set up targeting to help match your ads to the most relative sites based on topic, interested audiences, demographics, and more.
  - Useful for raising awareness and targeting customers with specific interests before they even know to search for you specifically.
  - Helps raise awareness, but is not the best for driving website visits.
- Search Network campaign with Display opt-in:
  - When you create a Search campaign, you have the option for "Display opt-in." This will cover both Search and Display networks seamlessly, and you only need to create Search ads.
- Video campaign
  - Can run ads on YouTube and other sites across the Google Display Network.
  - Available formates include:
    - TrueView in-stream ads
    - TrueView video discover ads
    - Bumper ads
  - Helps raise awareness, but is not the best for driving website visits.
- Shopping campaign
  - May display your ads in Google Shopping, next to search results and next to text and responsive ads.
  - May also display on YouTube and other Google Search partner sites.
  - Useful for retailers who want to promote online and local inventory, boost traffic to their site or local store, and find better qualified leads.
- Universal App campaign
  - For promoting apps.
  - Can display across Search, Display, and YouTube.
  - Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads for your app.
  - You provide:
    - Some text
    - A starting bid and budget
    - Languages and geographic locations for your ads.
  - Google's system will test different combinations and show best-performing ads more often.

## Campaign Goals

After you've selected a campaign type, you can select goals based on actions you'd like your customers to take. (Make a purchase, call you, etc.)

Once you choose these goals, AdWords recommends features and settings to help you.

(Adding a goal will not affect the auction or serving.)

## Campaign Settings

Campaign type determine where your ads will show, but you can tailor it further with campaign settings.

The settings you select apply to all ads in that campaign.

The type of campaign you selected affects which settings are available to you.

- Campaign Name
  - Not visible to customers, but helps you find the campaign you're looking for within your account.
- Campaign Type
  - Tailors the setup to your goals.
- Networks
  - Choose which networks you want your ads to display in. (Google Search Network, Google Display network, Search Partner sites such as CNN, etc.)
  - On Google Display Network, your ad is displayed on other sites that partner with Google to show ads.
- Devices
  - Campaigns target all types of mobile and desktop devices, but you can customize ads based on which device they're displaying on.
- Locations and Languages
  - Choose the language you serve your customers in.
  - You can also target certain geographic locations.
- Bidding and Budget
  - Manually set your bids for clicks on ads.
  - Or let AdWords do it for you.
  - Depending on campaign type, you may also see additional bidding options.
  - Bid Limit: The most you'll pay per click for ads in an ad group.
  - Budget: The average amount per day you're comfortable spending on your campaign. (Can be adjusted at any time.)
- Ad Extensions
  - Covered earlier. Add location, links to your site, interactive contact options, etc.
- Additional Settings (optional)
  - Schedule: Set campaign start and end date.
  - Ad Scheduling: Select specific days or hours to display your ads.
  - Ad Delivery: By default, AdWords displays your ads when they're more likely to get clicks or conversions. But you can override this to show your ads more evenly throughout the day.
  - Advanced Location Options
  - Campaign URL Options

## AdWords Account Structure

Keep your account organized so you can tell which campaigns belong to which accounts, and can quickly see how each is performing.

Organize by product or theme so that you can create ads according to product or theme.

The three layers of organization withing AdWords:

1. Account (Associated with a unique email address, password, and billing information.)
2. Campaign (Has its own budget and settings that determine where your ads appear.)
3. Ad Group (Contains a set of similar ads, as well as the keywords and phrases that trigger your ads to display. Separate these by product so you can control bids and budgets for each ad group.)

For example, at the Campaign level, a clothing retailer could set up one campaign per clothing type. (Jackets, Shoes, Bags, etc.) Can also do this for different promotions and regions.

At the Ad Group level, that same retailer could target subsets of each clothing type. (Jackets: Peacoats, Vests, Blazers, Windbreakers. Shoes: Heels, Flats, Boots. Bags: Clutch, Tote.)

The retailer can then assign keywords and bids unique to each Ad Group. They can then where and when ads specific to these types of products should appear. They can also adjust messaging and bids when competition, sales, or seasons strike.

If you are managing multiple AdWords accounts, you can create an AdWords manager account, allowing you to view and manage them all -- including other manager accounts.

## Targeting

### Your Target Customers

#### Who

##### Remarketing:

Example: You can target customers who abandoned a shopping cart without making a purchase, showing them ads for a discount.

[Use for Piel Canela -- anyone who visits the site should see ads for it later.]

##### Demographic Targeting:

Age ranges, genders, parental status, household income, etc.

[Piel Canela: Only advertise to pregnant women, which also means certain age ranges.]

#### Where

Can refer to geographical location, or where a customer is on the internet (contextual or topical targeting).

[Piel Canela: Only advertise to a certain ideal driving radius.]

#### What

What is of interest to your audience? You can specify keywords based on what people are searching for, and display your ads alongside those search results.

Example: You can create keywords like `flowers for mom`, and when people search for `flowers for mom`, your ad will display next to their search results.

[Piel Canela: massage, prenatal, etc.]

### Keywords

Building a solid keyword list helps you reach only the most interested people.

Example:

- Athletic Shoes
  - Running Shoes
  - Basketball Shoes
  - Soccer Shoes
  - Soccer Cleats

#### Think like a customer when you create your list

The biggest sources when brainstorming new keywords:

- Your website. (Find any gaps between your site's content and your keyword list.)
- Your products. (Bid on core product keywords. When your audience is at the end of the buying cycle, they'll be searching for a specific product or service. Product names and models can be great keywords here.)
- Your brand. (If you deal with multiple products, add keywords that are combinations of your brand name + high-volume products that people often search in the same query.)

#### Organize Keywords into Groups

Organize your keywords into well-defined groupings so you can better manage your account

You can group according to customer journey (upper funnel keywords, lower funnel keywords), product line, brand, geography, etc.

Example: A shoe store could create separate ad groups for athletic shoes and dress shoes. The ad group for athletic shoes could include keywords like "running shoes" and "basketball shoes." The ad group for dress shoes could include keywords like "evening shoes" and "dress shoes." This way customers who search for "evening shoes" don't see the ads for athletic shoes.

#### Specificity

Be specific, but know that if you get too specific, you may not reach many people. Keywords like "men's basketball shoes" would be good, for example.

Being general can be good for reaching more people, but potentially not as useful. "Shoes" may be so broad that you reach a lot of people who aren't related to the type of shoe business you're doing. Also, general keywords tend to cost more.

#### Negative Keywords

Negative keywords can help narrow your focus. For example, if you don't sell shoes with cleats, you could add "cleats" as a negative keyword so you don't waste money advertising to people who are looking for cleats.

#### Quantity

5 - 20 keywords per ad group is recommended. *Your keywords will automatically match common misspellings and pluralizations.*

Choose keywords that relate to the websites or apps your customers see. Example: if you create a keyword list with words relating to boots, your ads would target websites about boots. (You could also use negative keywords such as "ski" and "snowboard" to prevent your ads from appearing on sites about winter sports.)

[NOTE: I want to learn how to calibrate this process after it's set up. How do you decide how to alter keywords, etc. if you're not getting the results you want?]

[CUTM: Try targeting high school and college kids in the United States.]

## Triggering Ads

You can control how closely your keywords match a person's search terms before triggering your ad.

This is done using "keyword match types."

Keywords are *not* case sensitive. Common misspellings and synonyms are automatically included for you.

However, you can use match types to control which variations of keywords trigger your ads, so they don't show to people who are unlikely to become customers.

### Broad Match

Shows your ads based on keywords and close variations like misspellings and synonyms.

This is the default.

### Broad Match Modifier

Excludes synonyms.

To use this, add the `+` sign before terms.

### Phrase Match

Shows your ads based on exact phrases and close variations. This is more targeted.

To use this, add quotes around the terms.

### Exact Match

Exact keywords and close variations. The most narrow.

To use, add `[`brackets`]` around the term.

### Negative Match

Prevents ads from showing on unrelated sites.

To use, add `-` sign before the terms that you *don't* want to trigger ads.

## AdWords Auction

Your ad competes with other ads to display, and it's not simply based on the highest bidder. It's about what the most useful ad to the viewer will be. So you want to make your ads as useful as possible for your customers.

"AdWords Auction" calculates this according to:

- Your bid
- The ad formats you've enabled
- Your ad's expected click-through rate (CTR)
- Relevancy
- The landing page experience when a user clicks through to your site

This decides which ads appear, in what order, and how much the advertiser will need to pay for having the ad appear.

### How it Works

1. User types in a search.
2. AdWords finds all ads with keywords that match that search.
3. AdWords eliminates any ads that are irrelevant or ineligible.
4. AdWords displays only the ads that meet the Ad Rank threshold, in order of most likely to lead to clicks.

## Ad Rank

Here are the factors that determine your Ad Rank:

- Bid Amount. (The max you are willing to pay for a user to click through to your site. Not to be confused with the amount a click on your ad actually costs. But top bids are not a guarantee of ad placement.)
- Expected CTR (click-through rate). (Prediction of how often your ad will be clicked on for these particular search terms. How has your ad performed in the past?)
- Landing Page. (Your ad is only useful if it leads to something useful. Your landing page must be relevant, original, easily navigable, and articulate your business clearly.)
- Relevancy. (Analyzes the language in your ad to determine its relevancy to the search.)
- Ad Formats. (Using ad extensions such as sitelinks, address, or phone number can bolster your rank.)

### Quality Score

Quality Score is the 1-10 rating that is reported for each keyword in your account calculated by estimating the quality of your ads and their associated landing pages.

## Media Cost Models

- CPM: Cost per thousand impressions. (You pay for your ad to display all over the place. You pay a flat rate every time your ad is shown, regardless of its impact on customers.)
  - vCPM: Viewable cost per thousand impressions. (You only pay when your ads appear in visible areas on the internet. Costs a little more, but increases likelihood that customers will see your ads.)
- CPC: Cost Per Click. (You pay only when a customer clicks your ad.)
- CPV: Cost Per View. (Same as CPC, except your ad is a video. You only pay if someone watches your video or clicks around on it.)
- CPA: Cost Per Acquisition. (You only pay when a customer does something online that you want them to, like making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter after seeing or clicking on your ad. Costs a bit more because the publisher of the ad only gets paid for running your ad if someone clicks on it, but it's meant to drive more promising outcomes.)

### How to Choose a Cost Model

What is your goal with this ad? Customer . . .

- Walks away simply being familiar with your brand? (CPM or vCPM)
- Clicks through to check out your website? (CPC)
- Joins your loyalty program and creates an account? (CPA)
- Purchases something? (CPA)
- Watches your video? (CPV)

## Bidding Strategy

You can have AdWords bid higher for ads that serve specific business goals, such as expanding brand awareness, increasing site visits, or increasing sales.

### Factors

Factors to consider when choosing a bidding strategy:

- Your overall budget.
- Your campaign goals. (Do you want clicks? Impressions? Conversions?)
- The value of a sale or conversion. (Don't spend $100 for a click if the sale it generates will only be $2 -- but if a sale could generate thousands of dollars, then maybe spending $100 for a click is smart!)

### Manual vs. Automated

There are two ways to manage your AdWords bidding:

1. Manual
2. Automated

#### Manual Bidding

Lets you manually set bids at the ad group level, for individual keywords, or for ad placements, so you know you're bidding for the clicks that mean the most to you.

#### Automated Bidding

You set up a daily budget and let AdWords automatically adjust your bids to get the most clicks or conversions possible within your budget. (You can add certain keywords to a portfolio and set a target spend.)

You're likely to get better results if you start out manually, only enabling automated bidding once your campaign is getting at least 15 conversions and 15 clicks per month. (This kind of data helps the algorithm work its magic.)

Also, it is recommended that you enable conversion tracking when doing automated bidding.

### Use Your Goals to Determine a Bidding Strategy

- Goal: Build Awareness. (Focusing on impressions may be your best strategy. vCPM or CPV.)
- Goal: Drive Web Visits. (CPC -- manual or automatic -- is probably best.)
- Goal: Drive Online Sales. (CPA.)

Automated bidding strategies:

- Goal: Ad Clicks. ("Maximize Clicks" automatically sets your bids to try and get as many clicks as possible within your budget. Can increase site visits and increase clicks on low-traffic terms. Good for advertisers who are just starting out and want to drive customers to their website.)
- Goal: Ad Revenue. ("Target Return-on-Ad-Spend (ROAS)" bids more where AdWords estimates ads are more likely to get a sale. Good for advertisers who know the exact value of each conversion to their business.)
- Goal: Ad Conversions. ("Enhanced Cost Per Click (ECPC)," "Maximize Conversions," or "Target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)." More on these later.)

### Choose Bid Amount

Determine the right bid for you by . . .

- Cost of your keywords.
- Type of campaign you're running.
- Your profits.

Most people starting out in AdWords use CPC. You set the max you're willing to pay for each click.

Set your bid by thinking about how much an ad click is worth to you. If you're still unsure, try starting at a max of $1 per click.

There are also tools you can use:

#### Bid Simulator

Runs what-if scenarios such as, "How many more impressions would I have gotten if my bid had been $0.10 higher last week?"

#### Keyword Planner

Shows you how often certain keywords get clicked, and gives you cost estimates at a glance.

#### First-Page Bid Estimates

Helps you see how much you may need to bid to put your ad on the first page of Google results.

[NOTE: `Halloween short stories`]

### Reevaluating

Reevaluate your CPC bids regularly. Once you've set your maximum bids, see how many clicks accrue, and whether those clicks lead to business results on your website.

1. To see which keywords are leading to the most clicks in your ads, go to the "keywords" tab in your account. Try filtering your keywords by click-through rate to see which keywords get you a lot of impressions, but few clicks. If your goal is to generate sales, these are the keywords that are probably not working so well. Adjust your bids accordingly.
2. Once you’ve identified which keywords, locations, times, and devices are getting good results, you can adjust your bids accordingly. For instance, if a keyword has a low average CPC but each click converts well, you may try increasing its max CPC bid. This could improve the ad’s average position for that keyword, giving your ads more exposure and potentially increasing your ROI.

### Conversion Bidding Types

#### Enhanced Cost Per Click (ECPC)

Semi-automated. Adjusts your bids within your budget to get you as many conversions as possible.

Good for advertisers looking for an incremental increase in conversions while still retaining control over their keyword bids.

#### Maximize Conversions

Automatically sets bids at auction time to get you as much conversion volume as possible within your campaign's budget.

Good for advertisers with a fixed advertising budget already seeing at least 15 conversions and 15 clicks per month, who do not know how much they should be willing to pay for a conversion (no target CPA).

#### Target CPA

Automatically sets bids to help get as many conversions as possible at the target CPA you set (some conversions may cost more or less than your target). Target CPA does not operate within a set budget.

Good for advertisers who know how much they’re willing to pay for a conversion and prioritize maintaining a specific cost per conversion over driving conversion volume.

### Best Practices for Automated Bidding

- Transition from manual to automated bidding. The algorithm needs at least a couple weeks of data to make informed predictions. Keep campaign changes to a minimum during this time while the algorithm is learning.
- Set up conversion tracking. Required for automated bidding. Allows you to see how effectively your ad clicks lead to valuable customer activity, such as purchases or email sign-ups.
- Avoid frequent changes to bidding options. Try to keep Target CPA goals, ads, and campaign daily budgets fairly steady so the algorithm doesn't have to keep adapting.
- Review performance and make improvements. Use the bid strategy report to see how well your ads are performing. Make adjustments if necessary.

## Bid Adjustments

Once AdWords metrics show you which keywords, locations, times, and devices are getting better results, you can adjust your bids to favor the better performers.

A bid adjustment allows you to raise or lower your bids in certain scenarios. With bid adjustments, you can bid higher to increase the visibility of your ads. You can even adjust bids for devices your users are on, meaning you can bid different amounts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

For example, a restaurant may know that people are more likely to come in if they are nearby, so they can tailor their ads to more frequently target people who are nearby, and less frequently people who are farther away. (Maybe they want to bid 75% more for people who are nearby, 40% more for people a few miles away, and -40% for people twenty miles away.)

### Types of Bid Adjustments

- Device. (If you're promoting an app, raise bids for mobile users and decrease bids for desktop.)
- Location. (See restaurant example above.)
- Time of Day. (A meal delivery service could increase bids between 5-7pm to increase chances of showing ads to hungry commuters on their way home.)
- Top Content. (You could raise your bid for popular content, such as the hottest new cat video on YouTube. *Recommended for advanced users.*)
- Targeting Methods. (If you sell luggage, you could increase bids for travel websites in the Display Network. *Recommended for advanced users.*)
- Remarketing Lists for Search Ads. (You could increase your bid for people who previously viewed your website in the last 30 days. *Recommended for advanced users.*)
- Interactions. (You could increase your bid for mobile devices to show call interaction ads more frequently. These influence how often you show call extensions and call-only ads to users.)

## Aligning Your Budget with Your Goals

You set how much you are willing to spend per day in AdWords. Without a daily budget, you can't show your ads. Once your budget is reached for the day, your ads typically stop showing until the next day.

### Determining Your Daily Budget

Some options:

1. Calculate your daily budget based on your monthly budget. (Divide by 30.4 -- the average number of days per month. NOTE: Due to changes in traffic, AdWords allows up to 20% more clicks in a day than the budget specifies. However, in any given month, AdWords never charges more than the average daily budget amount multiplied by 30.4.)
2. Calculate based on your average cost-per-click (CPC). (If your CPC is $0.10, and you'd like 500 clicks per day, set your daily budget to $50.)
3. Find your campaign's recommended budget. AdWords shows recommended budgets based on:
  - Recent campaign performance.
  - Current campaign budget.
  - Keyword list.
  - Campaign targeting setting.
  - (NOTE: AdWords won't display a recommended daily budget if you rarely meet your daily budget, or if your campaign has limited data. If you don't see a recommended budget, and you know your ads aren't being shown as often as they could because your budget is limited, you might want to consider raising your budget to an amount that you're comfortable with.)
4. Check your ad delivery method. (When your average daily budget is reached, your ads will typically stop showing for that day. You'll want to consider your campaign's ad delivery method, which determines how quickly your ads are shown and how long your budget lasts during a given day, when setting your daily budget. The "Standard" delivery method is like a slow-burning candle -- it spreads your budget throughout the day. The "Accelerated" delivery method is more like jet fuel -- it uses your budget more quickly. Accelerated delivery is ideal for advertisers who want to show results more quickly.)

It's ideal to start with a low daily budget, and then as you see results, invest more in the areas that are driving your business.

### Three Stages

1. Build awareness of your business. (Requires a larger budget due to the longer path to conversion, and the scale at which you try to reach people.)
2. Influence consideration. (Encourage customers to explore your site. Can be accomplished with small, medium, or large budgets -- but with a medium path to conversion, a medium to large budget is wisest so you can reach a wider group of people and begin moving them to action.)
3. Drive action. (Have customers place orders, contact you, etc. This will be the smallest group of target audience who has made it this far in the sales funnel. You can meet all of your action goals with a small, medium, or large budget.)

The further along a customer gets in these stages, the more likely they are to buy.
