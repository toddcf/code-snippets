# AdWords Fundamentals

Ads should be clear, relevant, and include a link to your website.

## Types of Ads

- Text ads
- Image ads
- Video ads

## Google Network

The Google Network is made up of two networks:

1. Search
2. Display

These are the places your AdWords ads can appear, including: 

- Google sites
- Partner sites
- Mobile phone apps

### Google Search Network

Makes it easy for people to *search* for you on Google.

Set up your campaign to include certain search keywords (or phrases) people would type into Google, and your ads will display at the top of their search results.

### Google Display Network

Allows you to *display* your ads in places that are likely to reach your target audience. Your ads can appear on YouTube, Blogger, Gmail, and other Google sites.

You can still target wide or narrow demographics.
