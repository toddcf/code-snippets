# AdWords Fundamentals

Ads should be clear, relevant, and include a link to your website.

## Types of Ads

- Text ads
- Image ads
- Video ads

## Google Network

The Google Network is made up of two networks:

1. Search
2. Display

These are the places your AdWords ads can appear, including: 

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)
- Google partner sites
- Mobile phone apps

### Google Search Network

Makes it easy for people to *search* for you on Google.

Set up your campaign to include certain search keywords (or phrases) people would type into Google, and your ads will display at the top of their search results.

Your Search Network ads can appear on:

- Google sites (Google search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Play)

### Google Display Network

Allows you to *display* your ads in places that are likely to reach your target audience.

You can still target wide or narrow demographics.

Your Display Network ads can appear on:

- YouTube
- Blogger
- Gmail
- Other Google sites
- Google partner sites

### Text Ads

- Required:
  - Headline
  - URL
  - Description
- Optional:
  - Path Fields

#### Headline Tips

- People are most likely to notice the headline. Consider including at least one of your keywords in your headline.
- Two headline fields are available with up to 30 characters each.
- Consider how longer headlines might text wrap on smaller screens.

#### URL Details

If your final URL is www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants, only www.example.com will display. The rest will be in the Path fields.

#### Path Fields (optional)

There are two optional path fields, which can hold up to 15 characters each.

These come after your URL, and give the user an idea of what part of the site they'll be taken to -- but they are not the actual characters of the path.

For example, www.example.com/store/us/indoorplants might become www.example.com/Indoor-Plants.

#### Description Field

Up to 80 characters. Use to:

- Highlight unique details about your product or service.
- Include keywords that match probable search terms.

On mobile, where space is limited, AdWords optimizes your ads to show the highest-performing text.

#### Tips for Writing Effective Text Ads

Effective ads are:

- Specific
- Relevant
- Actionable

You should:

- Highlight what makes you unique.
- Use a CTA.
- Include sales terms. (Make sure customers know if there's a discount, sale, etc.)
- Include your keywords in the ad.
- Match your ad to your landing page. (Ensure your ad takes customers to the part of your site where they can act on it. Make the purchase easy for them.)
- Optimize your headlines. Headlines matter . . . a lot. They are the most likely thing your viewer will read. Also, keep in mind how the text will wrap on smaller screens.
- On mobile devices, use CTAs that engage mobile users particularly well.
- Use ad extensions. Including information below your ad, such as additional deep links into your website or business location, has been shown to increase your ad's performance.

#### Tips for Improving Landing Page Experience

The experience users have after they click your ad and visit your landing page URL is just as important as your ad itself. It affects:

- Ad Rank
- CPC (Cost per Click)
- Your position in the ad auction

A poor landing page experience can result in your ads showing less often -- or not at all. Here's how to avoid that:

- Offer relevant, useful, original content.
- Be specific. If a user clicks an ad for a specific sports car, they shouldn't be taken to a landing page for a variety of sports cars.
- Be general when the user wants more options, such as a comparision page of various camera models instead of one camera model.
- Be transparent about what your business does.
- Explain your products or services before asking users to fill out forms.
- Make it easy to find your contact info.
- If you request personal info from customers, be clear why you're asking for it and what you'll do with it.
- Distinguish sponsored links (like ads) from the rest of your website's content.
- Make mobile and desktop navigation easy.
- Avoid using pop-ups and other interferences.
- Show customers what they're looking for "above the fold."
- Make it quick and easy for customers to purchase whatever they saw in your ad.
- Keep landing page load times as fast as possible.

### Ad Extensions

Examples:

- Call buttons
- Location information
- Additional links
- Additional text

And more.

Benefits:

- The additional content gives your ad greater visibility and prominence on the search results page.
- Often gives you more value for your advertising investment.
  - Increases total number of clicks. (Average 10-15% increase for each type of extension implemented.)
  - Gives users interactive ways of contacting you.
- No cost to adding extensions.
  - Clicks on your ad are charged as usual. (You're charged when someone calls you from your call extension, or downloads your app from your app extension.)

There is no limit to the number of ad extensions you can add, but a maximum of four can show across an AdWords campaign at any given time.
  - Exception: Clicks on review extensions and seller ratings are not charged at all.

Specific Types of Extensions:

- Sitelinks. These display 6-8 additional links to specific pages on your site. (Store Hours, Locations, etc.)
- Callouts. Add additional text to your ad. ("Local flowers, Online ordering, Free delivery.")
- Structured Snippets. Highlight specific aspects of your products or services. These show underneath your ad as additional headers and lists. (Example: "Destinations," and "Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Africa".)
- Call Extensions. (Tap or click to call.)

AdWords even appends other extensions to your ads automatically when it predicts they will improve your performance.

In fact, none of your extensions display all the time. They are shown or hidden depending on AdWords' prediction of performance.

Also, you need to hit a minimum Ad Rank for any of your extensions to display at all. (More on this later.)

#### Deciding Which Ad Extensions to Use

 Because AdWords selects which extensions to hide or display based on each individual Google search, it makes sense to make use of all the extensions relevant to your business goals. Here are recommendations based on your goals:

- All Businesses
  - Sitelink Extensions
  - Callout Extensions
  - Structured Snippets
- Get customers to buy from your business locations.
  - Location extensions. (Location, call button, and a link to your business details page (hours, photos, directions).)
- Get customers to contact you.
  - Call extensions
  - Message extensions (text messaging). Can be added globally at the campaign level, or at ad group levels.
- Get customers to convert on your website.
  - Price Extensions. Allow customers to browse your products right in your ad, showing categories and prices.
  - Promotion extensions. Show specific sales and promotions across your ads. (30% off roses, etc.)
- Get people to download your app.
  - App extensions

## Campaign Types

- Search Network campaign
  - Appear near Google search results when people search for relevant keywords. Shows your ad to high-potential customers right when they're searching for related products or services.
  - Drives traffic to your site. Can also be used in tandem with other campaign types. 
- Display Network campaign
  - Ads appear throughout the Google Display Network, matching them to websites or mobile apps that contain content related to your business or to your customers' interests.
  - You can set up targeting to help match your ads to the most relative sites based on topic, interested audiences, demographics, and more.
  - Useful for raising awareness and targeting customers with specific interests before they even know to search for you specifically.
  - Helps raise awareness, but is not the best for driving website visits.
- Search Network campaign with Display opt-in:
  - When you create a Search campaign, you have the option for "Display opt-in." This will cover both Search and Display networks seamlessly, and you only need to create Search ads.
- Video campaign
  - Can run ads on YouTube and other sites across the Google Display Network.
  - Available formates include:
    - TrueView in-stream ads
    - TrueView video discover ads
    - Bumper ads

- Shopping campaign
  - May display your ads in Google Shopping, next to search results and next to text and responsive ads.
  - May also display on YouTube and other Google Search partner sites.
  - Useful for retailers who want to promote online and local inventory, boost traffic to their site or local store, and find better qualified leads.
- Universal App campaign
  - For promoting apps.
  - Can display across Search, Display, and YouTube.
  - Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads for your app.
  - You provide:
    - Some text
    - A starting bid and budget
    - Languages and geographic locations for your ads.
  - Google's system will test different combinations and show best-performing ads more often.

## Campaign Goals

After you've selected a campaign type, you can select goals based on actions you'd like your customers to take. (Make a purchase, call you, etc.)

Once you choose these goals, AdWords recommends features and settings to help you.

(Adding a goal will not affect the auction or serving.)

## Campaign Settings

Campaign type determine where your ads will show, but you can tailor it further with campaign settings.

The settings you select apply to all ads in that campaign.

The type of campaign you selected affects which settings are available to you.

## AdWords Account Structure

Keep your account organized so you can tell which campaigns belong to which accounts, and can quickly see how each is performing.

Organize by product or theme so that you can create ads according to product or theme.

The three layers of organization withing AdWords:

1. Account (Associated with a unique email address, password, and billing information.)
2. Campaign (Has its own budget and settings that determine where your ads appear.)
3. Ad Group (Contains a set of similar ads, as well as the keywords and phrases that trigger your ads to display. Separate these by product so you can control bids and budgets for each ad group.)

For example, at the Campaign level, a clothing retailer could set up one campaign per clothing type. (Jackets, Shoes, Bags, etc.) Can also do this for different promotions and regions.

At the Ad Group level, that same retailer could target subsets of each clothing type. (Jackets: Peacoats, Vests, Blazers, Windbreakers. Shoes: Heels, Flats, Boots. Bags: Clutch, Tote.)

The retailer can then assign keywords and bids unique to each Ad Group. They can then where and when ads specific to these types of products should appear. They can also adjust messaging and bids when competition, sales, or seasons strike.

If you are managing multiple AdWords accounts, you can create an AdWords manager account, allowing you to view and manage them all -- including other manager accounts.

## Targeting

### Your Target Customers

#### Who

##### Remarketing:

Example: You can target customers who abandoned a shopping cart without making a purchase, showing them ads for a discount.

[Use for Piel Canela -- anyone who visits the site should see ads for it later.]

##### Demographic Targeting:

Age ranges, genders, parental status, household income, etc.

[Piel Canela: Only advertise to pregnant women, which also means certain age ranges.]

#### Where

Can refer to geographical location, or where a customer is on the internet (contextual or topical targeting).

[Piel Canela: Only advertise to a certain ideal driving radius.]

#### What

What is of interest to your audience? You can specify keywords based on what people are searching for, and display your ads alongside those search results.

Example: You can create keywords like `flowers for mom`, and when people search for `flowers for mom`, your ad will display next to their search results.

[Piel Canela: massage, prenatal, etc.]

### Keywords

Building a solid keyword list helps you reach only the most interested people.

Example:

- Athletic Shoes
  - Running Shoes
  - Basketball Shoes
  - Soccer Shoes
  - Soccer Cleats

#### Think like a customer when you create your list

The biggest sources when brainstorming new keywords:

- Your website. (Find any gaps between your site's content and your keyword list.)
- Your products. (Bid on core product keywords. When your audience is at the end of the buying cycle, they'll be searching for a specific product or service. Product names and models can be great keywords here.)
- Your brand. (If you deal with multiple products, add keywords that are combinations of your brand name + high-volume products that people often search in the same query.)

#### Organize Keywords into Groups

Organize your keywords into well-defined groupings so you can better manage your account

You can group according to customer journey (upper funnel keywords, lower funnel keywords), product line, brand, geography, etc.

Example: A shoe store could create separate ad groups for athletic shoes and dress shoes. The ad group for athletic shoes could include keywords like "running shoes" and "basketball shoes." The ad group for dress shoes could include keywords like "evening shoes" and "dress shoes." This way customers who search for "evening shoes" don't see the ads for athletic shoes.

#### Specificity

Be specific, but know that if you get too specific, you may not reach many people. Keywords like "men's basketball shoes" would be good, for example.

Being general can be good for reaching more people, but potentially not as useful. "Shoes" may be so broad that you reach a lot of people who aren't related to the type of shoe business you're doing. Also, general keywords tend to cost more.

#### Negative Keywords

Negative keywords can help narrow your focus. For example, if you don't sell shoes with cleats, you could add "cleats" as a negative keyword so you don't waste money advertising to people who are looking for cleats.

#### Quantity

5 - 20 keywords per ad group is recommended. *Your keywords will automatically match common misspellings and pluralizations.*

Choose keywords that relate to the websites or apps your customers see. Example: if you create a keyword list with words relating to boots, your ads would target websites about boots. (You could also use negative keywords such as "ski" and "snowboard" to prevent your ads from appearing on sites about winter sports.)

[NOTE: I want to learn how to calibrate this process after it's set up. How do you decide how to alter keywords, etc. if you're not getting the results you want?]

[CUTM: Try targeting high school and college kids in the United States.]

## Triggering Ads

You can control how closely your keywords match a person's search terms before triggering your ad.

This is done using "keyword match types."

Keywords are *not* case sensitive. Common misspellings and synonyms are automatically included for you.

However, you can use match types to control which variations of keywords trigger your ads, so they don't show to people who are unlikely to become customers.

### Broad Match

Shows your ads based on keywords and close variations like misspellings and synonyms.

This is the default.

### Broad Match Modifier

Excludes synonyms.

To use this, add the `+` sign before terms.

### Phrase Match

Shows your ads based on exact phrases and close variations. This is more targeted.

To use this, add quotes around the terms.

### Exact Match

Exact keywords and close variations. The most narrow.

To use, add `[`brackets`]` around the term.

### Negative Match

Prevents ads from showing on unrelated sites.

To use, add `-` sign before the terms that you *don't* want to trigger ads.
