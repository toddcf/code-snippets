#Icons

- Icons improve the aesthetic of a website.
- If well-used, icons provide a better user experience. Can cause user confusion if poorly-used.

##Basic Guidelines

1. Use icons to show:
  - Features of your website.
  - Product that you're selling.
  - Steps a user should take to achieve a goal.
  - Actions.
  - Links. (See Facebook or YouTube for examples of this.)
2. Icons should be:
  - Recognizable.
  - Labeled.
3. Icons should play a supporting role, *not* take a center stage in your design.
4. Two types of icon formats:
  - Static Image.
  - Vector Icon Font. USE THESE!
    - Smoother; scale endlessly up and down for any resolution.
