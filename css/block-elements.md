# Block and Inline Elements

In HTML, there are "block" elements and "inline" elements.

## Block Elements

Block elements use the full width of the browser, and force line breaks. (Headings and paragraphs are examples of block elements.)

## Inline Elements

Inline elements don't do any of that. (Examples: images, links, strong, em, u.) You cannot set their height or width.

`display: inline;`

## Inline-Block Elements

Like an inline element, but can have padding and margin. Does not force a line break.

`display: inline-block;`
