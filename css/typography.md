#Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and beautiful.

Good typography can make any design look professional.

##Font Size

1. For standard text, use a font between 15px and 25px. Depends on:
  - the typeface you choose.
  - How much text you have.
  - How much you want that text to stand out.
2. For headlines and titles, use a font between 32px and 60px. In some cases, you can go up to 90px.
  - When you use a really big headline, you may want to decrease the font-weight of that text. This makes the text look less bulky, and more modern and elegant. It will also not distract from other text on the page.

##Line Spacing

Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines of text.

1. Use line spacing between 120% and 150%.

##Characters per Line

1. 45 to 90 characters per line is ideal.
  - Exception: Can be more narrow if you're using columns with text.
  - Too wide makes it hard on our eyes to travel such a long distance from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line while reading.

##Fonts

1. Sans-serif is easier to read.
  - It is:
    - Clean.
    - Modern.
    - Simple.
    - Neutral.
  - Good Google Web Font Examples:
    - Open Sans.
    - Lato.
    - Raleway.
    - Monsterrat.
    - PT Sans.
2. Serif fonts.
  - Used in:
    - Traditional purposes.
    - Storytelling.
    - Long reading (blogs, etc.).
  - Good Google Web Font Examples:
    - Cardo.
    - Merriweather.
    - PT Serif.

###How To Choose A Font

1. Choose a font which reflects the look and feel of your website.
2. Based on that, you can decide between serif or sans-serif.
3. Use only that one typeface. If you do need to pair two different fonts:

1. Use only one base color. (Any color other than black, white, or grey.)
  - Having too many colors on a website gets distracting and messy.
  - Sites that can help you choose your base color:

2. To use multiple colors, use a color wheel tool.
  - Sites that can help you choose color variations:

3. Use your main colors to call attention to certain aspects of your web page, such as a call to action button. (Maybe green is the main color of your website, and the button is orange.)
  - The second and third colors can complement the main color.
  - Pick a color that stands out and use it to draw attention to a button or any other element on your website.
4. Never use black in your design. Pure black almost never occurs in the real world, and therefore does not feel natural in your design.
5. Psychological effects of colors:
  - Red:
