#Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and beautiful.

Good typography can make any design look professional.

##Font Size

1. For standard text, use a font between 15px and 25px. Depends on:
  - the typeface you choose.
  - How much text you have.
  - How much you want that text to stand out.
2. For headlines and titles, use a font between 32px and 60px. In some cases, you can go up to 90px.
  - When you use a really big headline, you may want to decrease the font-weight of that text. This makes the text look less bulky, and more modern and elegant. It will also not distract from other text on the page.

##Line Spacing

Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines of text.

1. Use line spacing between 120% and 150%.

##Characters per Line

1. 45 to 90 characters per line is ideal.
  - Exception: Can be more narrow if you're using columns with text.
  - Too wide makes it hard on our eyes to travel such a long distance from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line while reading.

##Fonts

1. Sans-serif is easier to read.
  - It is:
    - Clean.
    - Modern.
    - Simple.
    - Neutral.
  - Good Google Web Font Examples:
    - Open Sans.
    - Lato.
    - Raleway.
    - Monsterrat.
    - PT Sans.
2. Serif fonts.
  - Used in:
    - Traditional purposes.
    - Storytelling.
    - Long reading (blogs, etc.).
  - Good Google Web Font Examples:
    - Cardo.
    - Merriweather.
    - PT Serif.

###How To Choose A Font

1. Choose a font which reflects the look and feel of your website.
2. Based on that, you can decide between serif or sans-serif.
3. Use only that one typeface. If you do need to pair two different fonts:
