#Images

Image-heavy websites convert better.

##Text Over Images

Works best if image is dark and text is white or light. You need enough contrast for readability.

###Color Overlay

One solution is to overlay the image with a color, such as black. This simply makes the image darker. (Like Onnit.com.)
Can also use other colors for overlay besides black.

###Text Box

- You can put your text in a box over the image in order to make it stand out and easy to read.
- The box should be opaque so you can still see the image beneath it.
- Could be a white color with some transparency. Or could be black, or another color that complements your design.

###Image Blur

- You can use image blur for the background image, which will make the text overlay easier to read.
- Can use an entirely blurry image.
- Or can use an out-of-focus area of the image.
  - If you do this, you must make sure the text stays over the blurry area on all screen resolutions. (Responsive web design.)

###Floor Fade

- The image subtly fades toward black near the bottom. Can put white text over this area.
