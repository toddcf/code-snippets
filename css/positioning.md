# Positioning

## Relative

- An element's position is determined by the positions of other elements on the page.
- Elements simply appear on the website in the order they are defined in the HTML document.
- You can use `margin`s to relatively position elements and create space between them.

## Absolute

- In absolute positioning, you use the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties to position this element within their parent element.
- The parent element must be `position: relative`, or else the browser will not know where to position the absolute element.

## Fixed

- Element stays in a fixed position, regardless of user's scrolling.

`position: fixed;`
