# Responsive Web Design

1. Fluid Grid.
  - All layout elements are sized in relative units, such as percentages (not absolute units such as pixels).
2. Flexible Images.
  - Also sized in relative units.
  - This prevents images from displaying outside their parent elements.
3. Media Queries.
  - Allows us to specify different CSS style rules for different screen widths.
