#Spacing and Layout

##Whitespace

###Overview

- Every piece of good design uses whitespace well.
- You need a lot of whitespaces in the correct places on your site.
- Gives a clean, simple, inviting look and feel. Without whitespace, looks and feels cluttered and claustrophobic.
- Put whitespace between:
  - Elements.
  - Groups of elements.
  - Icons and text.
  - Sections.
  - Sections' headings and their content.
  - Paragraphs.
- But don't exaggerate. When elements are spaced out too much, they may lose their relationships to one another.
- Whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of your website. Communicates how the pieces of the website relate to one another.

###Placing Whitespace

1. Define where you want your audience to look first.
2. Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message.
  - This hierarchy will guide the user from one element to the next.
3. Use whitespace to build that exact flow.
