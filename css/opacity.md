# Opacity

`opacity: 0.7;` would make the image (or whatever) partially transparent.

The color it would fade toward would depend upon the color of the background behind it. To control this, set the element's background color to something specific.

The higher the opacity value, the more normal the image. The lower the opacity value, the more transparent it is.

For example, `opacity: 0.7;` would be more subtle than `opacity: 0.3;`. `opacity: 0.7;` would be almost the same color as its background color.
