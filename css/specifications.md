# CSS Specifications

CSS specifications are found here: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/

These specs are largely geared toward implementers (meaning those who develop web browsers and need to know how their browsers should interpret CSS code). But authors (those who write CSS code for websites) can use these specs to gain a deeper understanding, too.

They are broken apart into separate modules.

Under the "Standards & Drafts" section, you'll see a list of "Completed Work." The most current snapshot will be at the top.


## Stages of Drafts

1. Working Draft (Still in progress.)
2. Candidate Recommendation (Users can start trying it out, but more changes may come.)
3. Recommendation (Officially ready to use -- but note that this does not always mean it's available in the browsers.)
