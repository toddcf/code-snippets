# CSS Specifications

CSS specifications are found here: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/

These specs are largely geared toward implementers (meaning those who develop web browsers and need to know how their browsers should interpret CSS code). But authors (those who write CSS code for websites) can use these specs to gain a deeper understanding, too.

They are broken apart into separate modules.

Under the "Standards & Drafts" section, you'll see a list of "Completed Work." The most current snapshot will be at the top.


## Stages of Drafts

1. Working Draft (Still in progress.)
2. Candidate Recommendation (Users can start trying it out, but more changes may come.)
3. Recommendation (Officially ready to use -- but note that this does not always mean that implementers have added it to their respective browsers' capabilities yet.)


## Official Definition (Section 2 of the CSS Specs)

This section tells you which version is considered widely used and stable.

Note that CSS Level 3 builds on and modifies Level 2.1, but it is intended never to contradict it. It will only build upon it, not remove existing features. This is so that udpates to the CSS language do not break existing websites across the internet.

Therefore, CSS will not have level numbers beyond 3.
