# Background

## Background Image

`background-image: url(../img/food/hero.jpg);`

## Fixed Background

If you don't want the background to move:
  - `background-attachment: fixed;`
  - Note that this does not work on iOS devices. Use a media query to target smaller devices and set it to:
  - `background-attachment: scroll;`
