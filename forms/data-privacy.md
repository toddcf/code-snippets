# Data Privacy

After you collect information from users, you can't just do whatever you want with it. Many countries have laws on when and how you can collect personal information, how you store that info, and what you can do with it.


## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

Under the age of 13, a child's parents must give permission before you collect their information. Most companies simply avoid this by not letting children sign up on their site.


## Security Breaches

You are likely required by law to notify users if there has been a security breach affecting their personal information.


## Email Lists

In the United States, you cannot send commercial emails without the consent of the recipient. They can sign up, or you may have a business relationship (such as they purchased something from you). You must give people the option to opt-out, and if they do opt out, you must stop emailing them.

Email laws are usually based *in the country where the email is received*.
