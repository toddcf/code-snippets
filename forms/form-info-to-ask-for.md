# Form Info to Ask For

Ask for as little info as possible. The more info you request, the less likely users are to fill out your form. Or they will fill in fake data in required fields they don't wish to divulge, and you'll have unwanted clutter in your database.


## Credit Card Info

No need to ask the user what type of credit card they're entering. The credit card type will be automatically determined by the first two digits of the credit card number.

Also a nice feature to add is the CVV code. If the user enters an Amex card number, the CVV code field label should adjust to request a 4-digit code on the front of the card instead of a 3-digit code on the back of the card.


## Convenience of Data Persistency

Try to remember the user's data and preferences wherever possible, so you can save them time in filling things out.


## Tone

Think about *how* you're asking people for their information. And keep the tone consistent -- formal or informal, etc.


## Lean Text

Ask your questions as concisely as possible. The more text the user has to read (even if you're trying to sound conversational), the longer it will take them to fill out  the form.


## Set Clear Expectations

If a form is complicated, tell the user up front. Let them know if there are certain documents they'll need. If there are links to the documents they'll need, provide those up front, as well.

But *do not* put a lot of instructions at the top of the form. Users are likely to just skip them.


## Password Requirements

Always tell the user the parameters for choosing a password. Don't wait for them to enter one before telling them they did it wrong.

Show a list of parameters next to the form. Extra nice: check off the requirements as the user is typing in a password that satisfies each one.

Have a "show password" option.

Also, have a "confirm password" field.


## User Mistakes

If a user makes a mistake filling out a form, be very specific in telling them what they did wrong.


## User Confidence

If you are asking someone to sign up for a paid service, many users will be worried about getting charged for something they didn't actually want. Say things like, "free trial" and "no credit card required."


## Logical Order

Make sure the fields are in a logical order. (Don't ask for last name before first name, etc.)


## Multiple-Page Forms

If you will be requesting a lot of information, consider spreading it out across multiple pages. For example, the first page can simply be creating a username and password. The next page can collect contact info, etc.


## Multi-Tier Forms

AirBNB has you fill out the city you want first. Only after you've submitted that does it let you filter the results by date, price, etc. This makes for a better user experience.


## Gradual Engagement

Start off slow, so as to not scare the user off. After they fill out a small part of the form, they feel more confident about continuing on to fill out more info on the additional pages.
