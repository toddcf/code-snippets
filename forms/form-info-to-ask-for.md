# Form Info to Ask For

Ask for as little info as possible. The more info you request, the less likely users are to fill out your form. Or they will fill in fake data in required fields they don't wish to divulge, and you'll have unwanted clutter in your database.


## Credit Card Info

No need to ask the user what type of credit card they're entering. The credit card type will be automatically determined by the first two digits of the credit card number.

Also a nice feature to add is the CVV code. If the user enters an Amex card number, the CVV code field label should adjust to request a 4-digit code on the front of the card instead of a 3-digit code on the back of the card.


## Convenience of Data Persistency

Try to remember the user's data and preferences wherever possible, so you can save them time in filling things out.
