# Photoshop - Resizing

1. In the layers panel, select the layer you want to resize.
2. Click Edit > Free Transform.
3. Drag and drop the points on the element that you wish to resize. (To keep the ratio the same, hold `SHIFT` and only drag and drop the corner points.)
4. To finish, click the checkmark button on the top right of the toolbar. Or hit `CTRL` + `ENTER`.
