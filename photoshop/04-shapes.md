# Photoshop Shapes

## Snap To Pixels

To make pixel-perfect shapes:

1. Click the dropdown arrow in the shapes toolbar across the top.
2. "Rectangle Options" dialog box opens.
3. Check the "Snap To Pixels" box.

## Squares

Use "rectangle" to make a square.

Hold down shift while you're dragging in order to keep the rectangle a perfect square. LET GO OF THE MOUSE *BEFORE* LETTING GO OF SHIFT, or you will lose your perfect square.

## Circles

Use "ellipse" to make a circle.

## Color

In the layers section, you will see two icons next to your shape's layer:

Left: Color
Right: Vector Mask (essentially the shape)

Double click the color icon to bring up the color dialog box and make changes.

To reference a color (find out what an existing color's code is): while the dialog box is open, just hover over the color you want to reference. The cursor will change to an eyedropper. Click, and your selected shape will change to the exact same color -- and you'll be able to view its code in the dialog box.
