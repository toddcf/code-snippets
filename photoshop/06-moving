# Photoshop - Moving

1. Select the MOVE tool. (Top of left-hand toolbar. Shortcut key = `v`.)
2. Make sure you have the correct layer selected in the layer panel.
3. You can drag and drop the element with the mouse, but it's not precise. Hold `SHIFT` while doing this to move it in a straight line. You can go horizontally, vertically, and even diagonally.
