# Layers

Every time you make a new layer, it adds it on top of the current layer.

## Naming

ALWAYS NAME YOUR LAYERS. This prevents you from getting lost.

In the layers tab on the right, double click on the layer name to rename it.

If you forget to do this, you can uncheck each layer in the left column and watch which element disappears on your canvas.
