# Layers

Every time you make a new layer, it adds it on top of the current layer.

## Naming

ALWAYS NAME YOUR LAYERS. This prevents you from getting lost.

In the layers panel on the right, double click on the layer name to rename it. (If the layers panel is not open, click Window > Layers.)

If you forget to do this, you can uncheck each layer in the left column and watch which element disappears on your canvas.

## Grouping

You can group layers together to make things more manageable.

## Changing Order of Layers

In the layers panel, you can simply drag and drop the order of the layers to change which are on top. (The layers at the top of the list are above the layers below them in terms of z-index.)
