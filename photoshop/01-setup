# Photoshop Setup

1. File > New
  i. Files are saved with `.psd` extension, which stands for Photoshop Design.
  ii. In the `preset` dropdown menu, you can select `web`.
  iii. Choose pixel size. Leave units as pixels for web design. (Inches and cm are for print design.)
  iv. Resolution is always `72` pixels per square inch. (Print design would be `300`.)
  v. Choose your background color. (White, Background Color, Transparent.)

  Note that you can change these settings again while working on the document.

2. Mutliple Documents

To work on multiple documents at the same time, also do File > New when you already have a file open. You can then toggle between the different projects using their tabs along the top.
