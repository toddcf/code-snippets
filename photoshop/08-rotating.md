# Photoshop - Rotating

1. In the layers panel, select the layer you wish to rotate.
2. Hit `CTRL` + `T`, which is the shortcut for Free Transform.
3. Click, hold, and then move the image around with your cursor. (Hold `SHIFT` while doing this to have it snap to preset angles as it spins.)
4. When finished, press `CTRL` + `ENTER`.
