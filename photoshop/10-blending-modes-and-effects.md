# Photoshop - Blending Modes and Effects

## Blending Modes

Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other.

1. Select the layer you wish to work with.
2. Using the dropdown at the top of the layers panel, choose the blending mode. (Multiply, etc.)

## Effects

Effects are applied to a single layer -- shadows, inner shadows, emboss, gradients, etc.
