# Photoshop - Blending Modes and Effects

## Blending Modes

Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other.

1. Select the layer you wish to work with.
2. Using the dropdown at the top of the layers panel, choose the blending mode. (Multiply, etc.)
3. Shortcut: Once you've selected the dropdown, you can use your up and down arrow keys to scroll through all the options and see how each one looks on the selected element.

The way blending modes look depends heavily on the background, as that will affect the outcome.

## Effects

Effects are applied to a single layer -- shadows, inner shadows, bevel, emboss, gradients, etc.

1. In the layer panel, right click on the name of the layer, then select `Blending Options`.
2. A new dialog box opens. Along the left hand side, you'll see a list of styles. You must click on the WORD, not the checkbox, in order to see the effect applied to your selected element.
3. `Global Light` will adjust the angle of the light for all the elements in the entire project. Think of it like the angle of the sun.

Bevel and emboss can make your design look really cheap really quickly. But if you increase its `size` enough, it can give it a nice quality.

## Copy Styles From One Element To Another

If you've gotten your styles just right and want to copy them to another element rather than rebuilding them from scratch:

1. In the layers panel, select the element with the styles you want.
2. Hold `ALT`, then drag the style (listed beneath that element) that you want up to the element you wish to copy it to. Let go of the mouse before you let go of `ALT`.
