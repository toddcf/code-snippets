# Photoshop Setup

## Create a New File

Note that you can change these settings again while working on the document.

1. File > New
2. Files are saved with `.psd` extension, which stands for Photoshop Design.
3. In the `preset` dropdown menu, you can select `web`.
4. Choose pixel size. Leave units as pixels for web design. (Inches and cm are for print design.)
5. Resolution is always `72` pixels per square inch. (Print design would be `300`.)
6. Choose your background color. (White, Background Color, Transparent.)

## Changing Size Later On

If your web page needs more space, here's how to extend your canvas:

1. Find the background layer in your layers panel. Click on it to select it.
2. Press `CTRL` + `T`.
3. Now you can just drag the bottom of the element down (for example) to resize it.

## Mutliple Documents

To work on multiple documents at the same time, also do File > New when you already have a file open. You can then toggle between the different projects using their tabs along the top.
