# Conversion Techniques

1. Give away a free gift in exchange for signing up for an email list.
  - An ebook can be a good idea. If people like the book, they are more likely to buy something from you in the future.
2. Have a strong call to action button (such as signing up for email list, subscribing to something, buying something, etc.).
  - Don't just have it once; repeat it in multiple places on your site.
  - The more often, the better -- without spamming or frustrating the user.
