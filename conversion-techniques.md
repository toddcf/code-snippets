# Conversion Techniques

1. Give away a free gift in exchange for signing up for an email list.
  - An ebook can be a good idea. If people like the book, they are more likely to buy something from you in the future.
2. Have a strong call to action button (such as signing up for email list, subscribing to something, buying something, etc.).
  - Don't just have it once; repeat it in multiple places on your site.
  - The more often, the better -- without spamming or frustrating the user.
  - Examples:
    - On the navbar.
    - In the center of the landing page.
    - At the very bottom of the page.
    - A popup box.
  - Tell your user the benefit of clicking this call to action button.
  - Don't ask for any more information than you need in order for the user to sign up.
3. Social proof.
  - Testimonials from other users can be very persuasive.
  - Customers are more likely to trust other customers than they are to trust you.
4. Create urgency and scarcity.
  - Urgency is when a user is made to feel that they must act quickly -- now, rather than later. In your call to action buttons, use words like:
    - Now
    - Hurry
    - Instant
    - Immediately
  - Scarcity is the feeling that a product or service is in short supply. When there is less of anything, we tend to value it more. Incentivizes people to act now rather than later.
