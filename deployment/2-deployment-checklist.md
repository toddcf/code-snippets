# Deployment Checklist

Once the Pre-Deployment Checklist is complete, you are ready to go live:


## GH Pages

1. Deploy to GH Pages first as a "preprod" test: https://github.com/toddcf/code-snippets/blob/master/git/common-commands.md
2. Check console for warnings or errors on every single page.


## Private Hosting (Dreamhost)

- Upload via SFTP (FileZilla):
  - Only the changed files.
  - Only the minified files -- not the non-minified working files.
