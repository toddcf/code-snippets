# Deployment Checklist

Once the Pre-Deployment Checklist is complete, you are ready to go live:


## GH Pages

Deploy to GH Pages first as a "preprod" test.  (Link to those instructions here.)


## Private Hosting (Dreamhost)

- Upload via SFTP (FileZilla):
  - Only the changed files.
  - Only the minified CSS and JS files -- not the non-minified working files.
