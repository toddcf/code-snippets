# Objects Compared to Arrays

## Arrays:

- Are used to store a list of data.
- Have a particular order to their data. (Every item is bound to an index number. These are key value pairs, just like objects, except that instead of a name and value, it's an index number and a value -- and they're always in order.)
- Actually ARE objects (as are most things in JavaScript).

## Objects:

- Do NOT have a particular order to their data. (Use key value pairs that use names and values instead of index numbers and values. They key can be anything.)

## In Short . . .

- Use an array when the order of the elements is important.

## Nesting

You can put arrays inside objects . . . and you can put objects inside arrays.
