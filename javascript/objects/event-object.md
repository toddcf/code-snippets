# Event Object

The event object can tell you:

- Where someone clicked on the page.
- Which key was pressed.
- Where they moved their mouse.


## Example

Try running this code:

```
window.onclick = (e) => { console.log(e); };
```

Now open the console and click anywhere on the page.

The console will display a set of data regarding this click event.
