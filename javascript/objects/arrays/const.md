# Const

`const` is used to declare a variable whose value CANNOT be changed. (Conversely, `let` is used to declare a variable whose value CAN be changed.)

## Benefits of Using Const

- When reading code, you can quickly tell that certain variables are not going to change, which can help you internalize what's going on faster. (Conversely, when you see `let`, you can quickly tell that that variable's value may change as the code is running.)
