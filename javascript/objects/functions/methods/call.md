# Call

`call()` is the same as [bind()](https://github.com/toddcf/code-snippets/blob/master/javascript/objects/functions/methods/bind.md), except that it will also automatically call the function (whereas `bind()` will need to be called manually after it has been set).

(If you need to bind a function and call it later, use `bind()`.  If you need to bind a function and call it immediately, use `call()`.)
