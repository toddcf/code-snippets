# Bind

Similar to [call](https://github.com/toddcf/code-snippets/blob/master/javascript/objects/functions/methods/call.md), but allows you to set the "this" variable explicitly.

BUT it does not immediately call the function.  Instead, it generates a copy of that function so that you can store it somewhere.
