# Return Keyword - JavaScript

A function takes input, executes the code inside the function, and then provides output, which is the "return."

This is different from `console.log();` because it actually "returns" the information into the operation, whereas `console.log();` simply prints the information to the screen (but the operation can do nothing with it).

Every function returns something, and if we don't explicitly tell it what to return, it just returns `undefined`.

As soon as a function "returns" something, it's done running. That's the end of the function's execution.
