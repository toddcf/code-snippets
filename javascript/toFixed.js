toFixed();
// Sets a number to have a specified number of decimal places.
// Returns it as a string.
// NOT part of the Math object.

// Example: Set num to have exactly two decimal points:
num = num.toFixed( 2 );
// Will add these decimal places if they are not there.
// Will trim off any additional decimal places if there are more than two (and rounds up if 5+).
