# Arguments

NOTE: ES6 uses `spread` instead of arguments. (See separate documentation.)

`arguments` is a special keyword or variable that is set up automatically by JavaScript in the execution context of a function.

`arguments` contains a list of all the values of all the parameters that you pass to a function.

NOTE: "Arguments" and "parameters" are the same thing. However, JavaScript gives you a keyword of `arguments` that contains them all. Therefore, when you're talking about the *concept* of arguments, you're just talking about the parameters you pass to your function. But the *keyword* `arguments` is something special that the JavaScript engine sets up for you.
