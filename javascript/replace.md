# Replace

Replaces specified text in a string. The general syntax is like saying, "Replace THIS with THAT."

```
let str = 'Here is some text.';

let result = str.replace( 'some', 'more' );

console.log(result);
```

This will print `Here is more text.` to the console.

NOTE: If you want to replace multiple things in a string, and/or things that follow a general pattern, see `regular expression`.
