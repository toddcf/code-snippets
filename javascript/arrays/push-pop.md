# Push-Pop

## Push

Push adds to the end of an array.

`colors.push( "green" );` would add `"green"` to the end of the `colors` array.

## Pop

Pop removes (and `return`s) the last item of an array.

So when you execute `colors.pop();`, it pulls the last element out of the `colors` array and displays it.
