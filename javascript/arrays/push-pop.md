# Push-Pop

## Push

`Push` adds to the *end* of an array. (To add to the *beginning* of an array, see `unshift`.)

`colors.push( "green" );` would add `"green"` to the end of the `colors` array.

## Pop

`Pop` removes (and `return`s) the *last* item of an array. (To remove the *first* item of an array, see `shift`.)

So when you execute `colors.pop();`, it pulls the last element out of the `colors` array and displays it.

## Name Origins

From older programming languages with "stacks" and "queues."

*An easy way to remember the difference is that the longer word makes the array longer.*
