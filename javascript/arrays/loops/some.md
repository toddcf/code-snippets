# Some

Condense everything in an array down into a single value.

*NOTE: This is a close cousin of "every."*


## When to Use some

You are basically asking, "Do ANY the records match my criteria?"

It is the equivalent of checking all the conditions with `||`. (By contrast, the `every` helper is the equivalent of checking all the conditions with `&&`.)
