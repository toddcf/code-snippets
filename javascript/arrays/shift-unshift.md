# Shift / Unshift

## Unshift

ADDS an item to the *beginning* of an array. (To add an item to the *end* of an array, see `push`.)

## Shift

REMOVES (and `return`s) the *first* item of an array. (To remove the *last* item of an array, see `pop`.)

`colors.shift();` will remove the first element from the `colors` array.

## Name Origins

From older programming languages with "stacks" and "queues."

*An easy way to remember the difference is that the longer word makes the array longer.*
