# indexOf

This will find the index number of an argument in a given array.

Meaning if you have an array that is a list of friend names and you want to know what index number "Charlie" is, you could write:

`friends.indexOf( "Charlie" );`

If not found, will return `-1`. (This can be useful if you want to use an if/else statement to tell the system to do something specific if the element is NOT found.)
