# Formatting Your Code

Airbnb and Google each have style guides. (Airbnb is considered by some to have a little bit nicer formatting, so I'm going to use that.)

ESLint and Prettier are two tools that can be installed in your text editor to help.


## ESLint

A linter tool used to identify potential problems in your JavaScript code. (Bad practices or design patterns. Or unused variables or functions.)

You can also paste your code into the demo on the ESLint website.
