# DOM Events

Clicking, keypresses, hovering, dragging and dropping.

## Event Listeners

Once you've selected an element, you can add an event listener to it, meaning it is waiting for that event to occur (a click, etc.) so it can execute its code. This is done with `addEventListener`:

`element.addEventListener( type, functionToCall );`
