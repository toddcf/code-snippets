# jQuery Overview

jQuery is a DOM manipulation library. Helps us do more with less code.

## Reasons To Use jQuery

- Fixes "broken" DOM API -- back when it was broken.
- Brevity and clarity.
- Ease of use.
- Cross-browser support.
- AJAX.
- Popular with many coders, meaning there is a strong community and lots of resources to consult.

## Reasons NOT To Use jQuery

- The DOM API is no longer "broken."
- You can do everything jQuery does on your own, often with the same amount of code.
- It's an unnecessary dependency.
- Can unnecessarily slow down performance. If you're only using it for a few things, you're still loading the entire library.
- Many people are actually moving away from using jQuery!
