# Wireframing

## Tutorial Review:

1. Audio quality differs from video to video.
2. New GUI video should have replaced the old GUI video. It was confusing to watch the old video first, when the software I downloaded has a different GUI.
3. GUI in all the videos is old, and some of the menus are now different, which slowed down the learning process as I hunted around for everything (some of which had new names).
4. Good: Despite these issues, I was still able to get up and running with Pencil very quickly, and completed my wireframing project the same day.
5. Good: Each segment is extremely short.
