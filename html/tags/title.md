# Title

The `<title>` of an HTML document is what will show up in:

- Search Engine Results
- Browser Bookmarks
- Browser Tabs
- Browser History

When titling your document, keep each of these things in mind, as your title may be read out of context and you will still want it to come across clearly.  (For example, "Home" would not be a descriptive enough title.)

For this reason, a document's `<title>` is often different than its first heading, which does not have to stand alone out of context.

Each document can have only one `<title>`.
