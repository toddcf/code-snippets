# Strong vs. Bold

HTML has a `<strong>` and a `<b>` tag.


## <strong>

`<strong>` represents importance or seriousness.

Most browsers display `<strong>` text as bold, but, like `<em>`, you should not use `<strong>` for visual reasons.  (NOTE: To be safe, you can specify the type of styling you want your important text to have using CSS rathan than trust each browser to be consistent.)


## <b>

`<b>` will visually make your text bold without conveying that that text is urgent.  This could be used to visually differentiate some text from its surrounding text.
