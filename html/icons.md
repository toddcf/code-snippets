# Icons

## Ion Icons

1. Download from http://ionicons.com/
2. Link to the files you need in your HTML head just like you would with any other CSS stylesheet.
3. Place the icon you want where you want it in the HTML file like so: `<i class="ion-ios-infinite-outline"></i>` (for example).

## Icon Size

Treat it like a font. Give the `<i>` a class name. Then, in CSS:

`font-size: 400%;`, for example.
