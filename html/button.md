# Button

A button is intended to perform an action, such as submitting a form.

A button is *not* intended for navigation -- anchor tags (links) should always be used for that.  Although it is possible to style an anchor tag to look like a button, it should not actually be a `<button>` tag.

There are two types of buttons in HTML:


## Button Tag


## Input Tag with type="button"
