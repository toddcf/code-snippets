# Title

The `<title>` of an HTML document is what will show up in:

- Search Engine Results
- Browser Bookmarks
- Browser Tabs

When titling your document, keep each of these things in mind, as your title may be read out of context and you will still want it to come across clearly.  (For example, "Home" would not be a descriptive enough title.)
