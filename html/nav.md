# Nav

The `<nav>` element is short for "navigation."  It is used to contain links to other pages on the site, or to other sections on the same page.

Not all navigational links need to be contained inside `<nav>` tags.  For example, if you have navigation links inside your `<footer>`, being inside a `<footer>` tag is sufficient.

The `<nav>` tag is for major navigation blocks.
