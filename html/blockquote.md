# Blockquote

If you are quoting someone (a customer testimonial, for example), HTML has a tag called `<blockquote>` that is helpful.

Simply place your quote in between an opening and closing blockquote tag.  You can also use `<cite>` for the attribution.

You can even place an image inside the `<cite>` tags:

```
<blockquote>
	Omnifood is just awesome! I just launched a startup, which leaves me with no time for cooking, so Omnifood is a lifesaver. Now that I'm used to it, I can't live without my daily meals!
	<cite><img src="assets/img/customers/customer-1.jpg">Alberto Duncan</cite>
</blockquote>
```
