# Switch / Checkout Branch

## Switch (Newer, More Semantic Method)

`git switch <branch name>` allows you to switch to the branch name you type in.

To use `switch` to simultaneously create and switch to a new branch, see [Create Branch](2-create-branch.md).


## Checkout (Older, More General Method)

`git checkout <branch name>` will accomplish the same thing as `git switch`, but because `git checkout` can be used for both branches and commits, `git switch` was created exclusively for branches to reduce confusion.

NOTE: To do this via the Sourcetree UI instead of the command line, see [Sourcetree notes](https://github.com/toddcf/code-snippets/blob/master/sourcetree/sourcetree.md).
