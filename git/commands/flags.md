# Flags

Flags allow you to add options to your commands.

For example, you can dictate how you want the contents of a folder to be displayed in the terminal:

- `ls -s` will display the filesize of each file.
- `ls -l` will display the "long format" of each file.
- `ls -ls` will do both flags at once.

To see the full list, run `man ls` in the terminal.  This is short for "manual" plus the command you want to see the manual for.  It will display the documentation for that command.
