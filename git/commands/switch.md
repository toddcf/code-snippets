# Switch

`git switch` allows you to switch branches and create new branches.

Because `git checkout` can be used for both branches and commits, `git switch` is exclusively for branches to reduce confusion.  It can be used in place of `git checkout` if you are changing branches.

To create a new branch with `git switch`:

`git switch -c <new branch name>`
