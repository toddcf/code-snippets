# Git Overview

The official Git website is https://git-scm.com/.

Git is only local, however.  The full power of Git is when you sync it with a cloud account -- such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  This allows you not only a backup copy in case your local crashes, but also allows multiple users to access and edit the files.  Or it allows the same user to access their code from another computer.

A Git repository is a Git-managed project.

Git and GitHub work extremely well together, but they are two different services.
