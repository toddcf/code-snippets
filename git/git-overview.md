# Git Overview

The official Git website is https://git-scm.com/.

Git is only local, however.  The full power of Git is when you sync it with a cloud account -- such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  This allows you not only a backup copy in case your local crashes, but also allows multiple users to access and edit the files.  Or it allows the same user to access their code from another computer.

A Git repository is a Git-managed project.

Git and GitHub work extremely well together, but they are two different services.


## Using the Terminal

The terminal is a text-input way of controlling your computer, as opposed to a GUI (Graphic User Interface) such as the Explorer.


### Shell

A "shell" is terminal software -- a text-input interface.  The shell interprets our text input for the computer, so that it understands what we are telling it to do.

The Mac has two different shells: Bash (older) and Z-Shell (also called zsh) (newer).

Windows machines don't have the differentiation between the terminal and the shell.  There is the command prompt (cmd).  That is the traditional Windows shell.  If you open the command prompt, you open the hardware, which has the corresponding software on it.  PowerShell is a newer version of the command prompt.  It was released with Windows 7.  It looks very similar to the command prompt, but is very different.  It can take in different kinds of commands.  A third Windows option is Git Bash.  It is a Bash emulation for Windows.  It can give you a more similar experience if you're working on a Windows and Mac machine simultaneously.  It is not necessarily required to use Git.

To keep things simple, you can just use Command Prompt (cmd) on Windows.  It is a good starting point to learn the terminal; then you can dive into the PowerShell if required.

On Mac, you can just use Z-Shell.
