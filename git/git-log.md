# Git Log

Running `git log` will display all your commits, plus additional information about each one.  Each commit will be listed in descending order (most recent commit at the top).

Each commit you make gets a "commit id," which is a long string of gibberish unique to that commit.  This id can be used later to "check out" a specific commit.


# Reverting to Previous Commit

To go back to a previous commit, see [git-revert.md](reverting-changes.md).
