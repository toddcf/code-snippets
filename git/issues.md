# Issues

Issues are not actual branches and pull requests, but are a way to track everything that needs to be fixed (and when each one gets closed).

When using the GitHub feature for reporting issues, a best practice is to use this structure:

1. Version
2. Reproduction Link
3. Steps to Reproduce
4. What is Expected?
5. What is Actually Happening?
