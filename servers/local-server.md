# Local Server

To set up a local server:

## VS Code "Live Server" Extension

1. Install "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.
2. In the VS Code Explorer, right-click on your HTML file and select "Open with Live Server."

A new tab will open, hosted on `127.0.0.1`, which is the IP address for your local host server.  (You can actually type in `localhost` in place of that IP in the URL.)
