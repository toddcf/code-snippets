# Keywords

In addition to the keywords in the [meta tags](https://github.com/toddcf/code-snippets/blob/master/seo/meta-tags.md), you must place keywords strategically throughout the content of your website.

But don't overuse them -- search engines consider this "keyword spamming" and may penalize you.

Use keywords in the:

1. Title.
2. Meta Description tag.
3. Headings.
4. Links.
