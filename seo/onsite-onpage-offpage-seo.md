# Onsite, Onpage, Offpage SEO

## Onsite SEO

Focuses on making the entire website as efficient as possible from a search engine crawler perspective.

Makes sure robots know to crawl certain pages, and NOT crawl certain other pages. (But this is more advanced.)

Is also about making the user experience of navigating your site nice.

### Website Speed

Website speed factors into your onsite SEO. Test your site's speed at www.webpagetest.org. You can adjust the test to take place from the location that is nearest the majority of your website visitors. You can also test using different browser types. Look at your Google Analytics to see which browser most of your visitors are using.

Total load time is the most important result you want to look at. Anything below 5 seconds is generally okay. Anything below 3 seconds is generally fast.

The graph will break down how long each individual file from your website took to load.

#### First Time Byte

How long the server takes to respond and deliver the first bit of information.

#### Keep-Alive Enabled

The server connection staying live when you're requesting different information from it. (Rather than opening a new connection each time you click to a different page on the site.)

#### Compress Transfer

How well the file is compressed for transfer between the server and the client's browser.

#### Image Compression

Compressing your images allows them to load much faster.

#### Cache Static Content

Websites can cache local versions of themselves on the user's computer. If someone opens your webpage, and there are elements on that page that aren't going to change for the foreseeable future, those elements can be stored on the user's local computer. This means if they come back to your website later, those elements can load directly from their computer instead of the server, speeding up the load time.

You can set a rule that after X number of weeks, these elements have to be re-cached in case they have been updated.

#### Effective Use of CDN (Content Delivery Network)

The farther physical distance a request has to travel between client and server, the longer it will take.

A CDN lets you store certain elements of your webpage (such as images or videos) on different servers around the world in order to speed up load times for those areas. The request to load the web page will still come from the original server, but the heavy elements such as images and videos will come from the more local server.

If your site isn't media heavy, this is not a big deal. But if you have an ecommerce site with lots of images and videos and you're selling to people all over the world, a CDN is very important.

### Google Test Tool

Search Google for "google page speed test" and go to "pagespeed insights."

Paste in your URL and click "analyze."

No page will get a perfect score of 100, but the higher the better.

### Mobile-Friendliness



## Onpage SEO

Onpage SEO is making sure search engines understand what each individual page of your website is about.

The title of each page should have an appropriate keyword phrase. Use the one keyword phrase you are targeting for this page, not multiple keyword phrases, to avoid confusing the search engines.

Can take months for your site's authority to build up in Google to the point where it is recognized and ranked higher.

## Offpage SEO

Other websites talking about you and linking to you.

One example is if you make one of your pages about a certain person, you can tell that person about it and hopefully they will link to it from their own website.
