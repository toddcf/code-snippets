# Onsite, Onpage, Offpage SEO

## Onsite SEO

Focuses on making the entire website as efficient as possible from a search engine crawler perspective.

Makes sure robots know to crawl certain pages, and NOT crawl certain other pages. (But this is more advanced.)

Is also about making the user experience of navigating your site nice.

### Website Speed

Website speed factors into your onsite SEO. Test your site's speed at www.webpagetest.org. You can adjust the test to take place from the location that is nearest the majority of your website visitors. You can also test using different browser types. Look at your Google Analytics to see which browser most of your visitors are using.

Total load time is the most important result you want to look at. Anything below 5 seconds is generally okay. Anything below 3 seconds is generally fast.

The graph will break down how long each individual file from your website took to load.

#### First Time Byte

How long the server takes to respond and deliver the first bit of information.

#### Keep-Alive Enabled

The server connection staying live when you're requesting different information from it. (Rather than opening a new connection each time you click to a different page on the site.)

#### Compress Transfer

How well the file is compressed for transfer between the server and the client's browser.

#### Image Compression

Compressing your images allows them to load much faster.

#### Cache Static Content

Websites can cache local versions of themselves on the user's computer. If someone opens your webpage, and there are elements on that page that aren't going to change for the foreseeable future, those elements can be stored on the user's local computer. This means if they come back to your website later, those elements can load directly from their computer instead of the server, speeding up the load time.

You can set a rule that after X number of weeks, these elements have to be re-cached in case they have been updated.

#### Effective Use of CDN (Content Delivery Network)

The farther physical distance a request has to travel between client and server, the longer it will take.

A CDN lets you store certain elements of your webpage (such as images or videos) on different servers around the world in order to speed up load times for those areas. The request to load the web page will still come from the original server, but the heavy elements such as images and videos will come from the more local server.

If your site isn't media heavy, this is not a big deal. But if you have an ecommerce site with lots of images and videos and you're selling to people all over the world, a CDN is very important.

### Google Test Tool

Search Google for "google page speed test" and go to "pagespeed insights."

Paste in your URL and click "analyze."

No page will get a perfect score of 100, but the higher the better.

### Mobile-Friendliness

This is another key element of onsite SEO. If people have to pinch and zoom, they are going to give up. The site must be mobile responsive.

To see whether Google considers your site mobile friendly, type your URL into https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly.

## Onpage SEO

Onpage SEO is making sure search engines understand what each individual page of your website is about.

The title of each page should have an appropriate keyword phrase. Use the one keyword phrase you are targeting for this page, not multiple keyword phrases, to avoid confusing the search engines.

Can take months for your site's authority to build up in Google to the point where it is recognized and ranked higher.

### 8 Key Elements of Onpage SEO

1. Keyword Research.
  - Don't assume you know what your customers refer to your products or services as.
  - Do research to determine what phraseology your customers are most likely to use.
  - Incorporate those phrases in places like your page title, meta description, and heading tags.
  - To figure these phrases out:
    - Look at your competitors. See what keywords and phrases they are using on their sites.
    - Type those searches into Google and see what other keyword and phrase suggestions come up. Also, at the bottom of the Google search results page, it will show you a list or related searches.
    - Use the "google keyword planner" tool. (You need an Adwords account to use this tool, but you don't need to spend any money or input your credit card.) Enter your parameters. Then in the results, click on the "keyword ideas" tab and look at the "average monthly searches column" for those that are searched for between 100 - 1,000 times per month. (Higher than 1,000 is generally too competitive and difficult to rank for organically. Less than 100 is not a popular enough search.) Repeat this process for all the keywords you gathered from your competitor research and Google suggestions. You will wind up with several hundred keyword phrases you could target.
2. Page Title.
  - Max length: about 50 characters (or it will get cut off in search results).
  - This is not a heading that displays on the webpage itself. It is the text inside your `<title>` tag in your html file.
  - This text will be made bold when displayed in the search engine results, so it is important.
  - Go to https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag and enter potential titles to test how they would appear in search results.
  - Each page of your site should have a unique title.
3. Meta Description.
  - Max length: Approx. 150 characters, depending on letter size.
  - In your head: `<meta name="description" content="The world's leading juggling expert."/>`
  - This description will show up in the search results under your page title.
  - Google does not use this description as part of their crawling. BUT, if your keyword phrases are in the description, they will be in bold when displayed, which enhances your clickthrough rate. And clickthrough rate is part of Google's algorithm.
  - DO NOT have the same meta description on every page of your site. Each one should be unique. It's a ranking opportunity. It's an opportunity for you to pinpoint why your page is different. Have a unique target keyword phrase for each page of your site.
4. Heading Tags.
  - `<h1>`, for instance. Is visually seen on the webpage.
  - Heading tags are a strong indicator to Google as to the purpose of the page. Is the biggest onpage factor when it comes to SEO.
  - There should only be ONE `<h1>` in a page. Can use `<h2>`s and `<h3>`s, etc. These are subheadings, and can contain keyword phrases to help with SEO, but don't need to. In fact, to reduce rik of getting flagged as spam, just have your keyword phrases in your meta description, page title, `<h1>`, and once in your actual content text.
5. Content Writing.
  - Write original, great-quality content for each page on your site.
  - You need strong user signals to get higher pageranks. User signals are what a user does once they're on your site. Do they . . .
    - Click the innerlinks and explore the entire site?
    - Click the "back" button and leave the site completely?
    - Stay several minutes on the page they landed on and devour the content?
6. Alt Tags & Images.
  - Search engines love to incorporate images in their search results.
  - People are more likely to share your pages if you add images to them.
7. HTML5 Microdata.
  - Additional markup that surround items on your page so search engines know what those items are.
  - For example, if you have a recipe, you can markup around the recipe to tell search engines what it is. They will then be more likely to use that element in their search results.
  - Another example is an address or telephone number. If you tell search engines specifically that these elements are addresses and phone numbers, they are more confident including them in their search results.
8. Internal Linking.
  - If you have a logical flow of linking between the various pages of your site, and you use certain phraseology that makes it clear to the search engine what the page these links point to is likely about, that will assist with your SEO.

## Offpage SEO

Other websites talking about you and linking to you.

One example is if you make one of your pages about a certain person, you can tell that person about it and hopefully they will link to it from their own website.
