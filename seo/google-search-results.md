# Google Search Results

## Paid vs. Organic Results

A paid result will show up as an ad in the search results. This is not necessarily better for you as a digital marketer. Most users know these are paid results and will skip past them. They trust organic search results more, and organic results tend to get 70-90% more clickthroughs.

Marketers bid on paid results for different keyword phrases. Can get expensive. You're paying for traffic, and you're probably not going to get as much traffic, ironically.

## How Search Engines Work

Crawl, Cache, Retrieve, Rank, SERP.

1. Crawl.
  - When a search engine robot crawls through your site and discovers your web pages. This is usually initiated when your site is backlinked from another site or mentioned somewhere online.
2. Cache.
  - The search engine robot decides what it wants to cache (store in its servers) from your website. It stores a simplified copy of your webpage on its servers.
3. Retrieve.
  - When someone conducts a search, Google (or whatever search engine) retrieves this cached information.
  - There could be thousands of web pages related to a particular query, and the search engine must decide which to retrieve.
4. Rank.
  - Once the results are retrieved, they are passed through Google's algorithm, which has over 200 elements that help it decide how to rank each result.
5. SERP (Search Engine Results Page).
  - Once the results have been ranked, they are displayed on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page).
