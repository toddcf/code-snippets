# Google Search Results

## Paid vs. Organic Results

A paid result will show up as an ad in the search results. This is not necessarily better for you as a digital marketer. Most users know these are paid results and will skip past them. They trust organic search results more, and organic results tend to get 70-90% more clickthroughs.

Marketers bid on paid results for different keyword phrases. Can get expensive. You're paying for traffic, and you're probably not going to get as much traffic, ironically.

## How Search Engines Work

Crawl, Cache, Retrieve, Rank, SERP.

1. Crawl.
  - When a search engine robot crawls through your site and discovers your web pages. This is usually initiated when your site is backlinked from another site or mentioned somewhere online.
    - However, backlinks are not the most important part of Google's algorithm. An article published six years ago might have been popular at the time and still have thousands of links pointing to it, but it's not necessarily still relevant today. Something published two hours ago that only has three links pointing to it so far might actually be *more* relevant.
  - One way to get discovered by Google is for your site to "hang out" with other similar sites. Google needs to know you are all related to the same keyword phrases. (See Touchgraph.)
  - Google doesn't look at your page visually, it looks at your source code. It looks at your:
    - Title.
    - Description.
    - Content of the site itself. What is your `<heading>`? What are your `<strong>` tags?
  - Google checks to see if you are publishing original content and seem reasonably authoritative.
2. Cache.
  - The search engine robot decides what it wants to cache (store in its servers) from your website. It stores a simplified copy of your webpage on its servers. (The source code, not the visual page.)
  - You can actually see where these servers are if you look up "Google Data Centers."
3. Retrieve.
  - When someone conducts a search, Google (or whatever search engine) retrieves this cached information from the nearest data center.
  - There could be thousands of web pages related to a particular query, and the search engine must decide which to retrieve.
4. Rank.
  - Once the results are retrieved, they are passed through Google's algorithm, which has over 200 elements that help it decide how to rank each result.
  - Pagerank was the key element in Google's original algorithm. It is how Google's search results were more relevant than other search engines' at the time.
  - See http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html for the original 1998 thesis, written by the Google founders.
  - Alta Vista originally based its search results on the keywords in websites' meta tags. But this was open to abuse, and people listed keywords that were not relevant to the pages. In 1998, Google improved on this with its backlink formula, figuring that a page was more relevant the more links it had pointing to it.
5. SERP (Search Engine Results Page).
  - Once the results have been ranked, they are displayed on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) in the order that the search engine has determined will be most relevant to you.

## How Google Prevents Gaming of the System

1. They check the quality of the links pointing to your site.
  - If the sites linking to you are low-ranked or obviously were just built for the purpose of linking to your site, they don't boost your ranking much.
2. Reciprocal Links.
  - If you and another site are linking to each other, it looks like quid pro quo, and does not help your rank.
  - If another site links to you and you *aren't* linking back to it, this looks like the site altruistically wants to link to you.
3. Link Farms.
  - These are sites you can go to to swap links. Google weeds these out of their rankings so as not to reward this behavior.
4. Doorway Pages.
  - A page created to show up in one type of search result, but when you click it, it takes you to the page the marketer actually wants you to go to.
  - In 2006, Google blacklisted BMW for doing this. If you searched "used car" and then went to one of the result links, it would wind up taking you to BMW's site. This was a breach of Google's guidelines, and they reduced BMW's page rank to zero, ensuring that it would not show up in searches. (BMW negotiated its way back in 3 days later, but the message was loud and clear to everyone.)
