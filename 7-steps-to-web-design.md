# 7 Steps To Web Design

1. Define Your Project.
  - Define your project's goal. For example:
    - Showing your portfolio to the world.
    - Selling an ebook.
    - Writing a blog.
  - Define Your Audience.
    - Who is the typical user who will visit my website?
  - Design the site with your goal and your audience in mind.
2. Plan Your Content Carefully.
  - "Content First" approach means thinking about what content your site will have, and designing your site around that. (As opposed to designing a web page and then filling it with some stuff.)
    - Text.
    - Images.
    - Videos.
    - Icons.
    - etc.
  - Think about visual hierarchy.
  - Define the navigation.
  - Define the site structure if it's a bigger project.
3. Sketch Your Ideas Before You Design.
  - Get inspired.
  - Sketch your ideas. Make as many as you want, but don't try to make them perfect.
  - Don't start designing until you have a good idea of what you want to build.
4. Design and Develop Your Website.
  - Use all the sketches and ideas you've created in steps 1, 2, and 3.
5. Optimize.
  - Optimize performance: site speed.
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
6. Deploy.
7. Maintenance.
  - Monitor users' behavior and make changes as necessary.
  - Update content regularly.
