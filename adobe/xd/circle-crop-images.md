# Adobe XD - Circle Crop an Image

1. Select the `ellipse` tool on the left-hand vertical toolbar.
2. Hold `shift` and drag and drop a circle around the approximate area of the image you want to keep.
3. Adjust opacity so you can see what you're doing:
  i. On the right-hand side, click `fill`.
  ii. Change `100%` to `50%` (for example).
4. Select the `select` tool on the left-hand vertical toolbar.
5. Now you can position the circle exactly where you want it.
6. Select both the image and your circle, then click `intersect` on the right-hand toolbar.
