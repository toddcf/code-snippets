# Layers

Every time you make a new layer, it adds it on top of the current layer.

## Naming

ALWAYS NAME YOUR LAYERS. This prevents you from getting lost.

In the layers panel on the right, double click on the layer name to rename it. (If the layers panel is not open, click Window > Layers.)

If you forget to do this, you can uncheck each layer in the left column and watch which element disappears on your canvas.

## Changing Order of Layers

In the layers panel, you can simply drag and drop the order of the layers to change which are on top. (The layers at the top of the list are above the layers below them in terms of z-index.) *Grab each layer by its name, not the color or vector mask icons.*

## Grouping

You can group layers together to make things more manageable.

1. Inside the layers panel, select all the layers you wish to group by holding `CTRL` and clicking each one, or holding `SHIFT` and clicking the first and then the last elements to select them and everything in between.
2. Press `CTRL` + `G` to group the selected layers together.
3. Name the new group that has just been created.

## Un-Grouping

To separate a layer from the group:

1. Click its name in the layers panel.
2. Drag it outside of the group and drop it elsewhere in the list.
