# Photoshop - Zooming and Panning

## Zooming

Zooming in allows you to check small details and make sure things are aligned.

1. Click the ZOOM tool at the bottom of the left-hand toobar.
2. Click on where you want to zoom in. Or drag and drop around the area you want to zoom into.
3. To zoom out, hold `ALT` while clicking.
4. Shortcuts: `CTRL` + `+` to zoom in, `CTRL` + `-` to zoom out.

## Panning

When zoomed in, you can pan around to see different parts of the image.

1. You can use the scroll bars, but this is a bit clunky.
2. The HAND tool (bottom of left-hand toolbar) is more convenient. Hold down `SPACE` and you can actually pull your image around. It's like moving a piece of paper around on a table.

## Importance of Viewing at 100%

When designing a website, it's important to keep an idea of how it looks at 100%.

1. Click `Z` for the zoom tool.
2. Right click on your canvas and select `Actual Pixels`. This will zoom to 100%.
