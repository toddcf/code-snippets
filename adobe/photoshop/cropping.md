# Cropping

## Circle-Crop an Image

1. Select the `elliptical marquee tool`.
2. Hold `shift`, then drag and drop a circle around the approximate area of the image you want to keep. (You can fine-tune the placement later. For now, just try to get the size of the circle correct.)
3. At the bottom of the `Layers` tab, click `Add Layer Mask`.
4. To reposition the area of the image that is being cropped, unlock the image by clicking the lock icon on that layer.
5. Select the `select` tool, then use it to drag and drop the image however you want it to be cropped within the masking layer's circle.
6. Once complete, click next to the image layer in the `Layers` tab to re-lock it to the masking layer.
7. To export as a PNG (keeping the background transparent), righ-click that layer and choose `Export as PNG`. Save only the image area, with a transparent background. This will eliminate the now-empty space that was the rest of the entire image.
