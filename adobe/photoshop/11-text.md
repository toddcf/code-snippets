# Text in Photoshop

## Creating or Selecting Text

In order to work with text in Photoshop, you MUST select the text tool from the vertical toolbar on the left-hand side. If you don't have this tool selected, you won't be able to change the text. Shortcut key: `T`.

When in text mode, be careful when and where you click. If you click on the canvas while NOT hovering over existing text, you will create a new layer of text. If you click on the canvas while hovering over existing text, you will begin editing that text. (If you screw up, just press `ESC`.)

Press `CTRL` + `ENTER` to solidify the text you've been editing.

## Fonts

Don't install too many fonts, or Photoshop will take a long time to load.

## Bounding Box

To create a box to contain your text:

1. Select the text tool.
2. Click and drag a box on your canvas. This is called a bounding box, and is where all your text will appear.
3. You can always change the size of this box later, and the text will only display where the box is -- there will be no spillover.

## Editing Text Styles

Above the layers panel is a CHARACTER panel. Click this to see all font options. (If you don't see this panel, click Window > Character.)
