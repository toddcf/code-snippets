# Photoshop - Moving

## Basics

1. Select the MOVE tool. (Top of left-hand toolbar. Shortcut key = `v`.)
2. Make sure you have the correct layer selected in the layer panel.
3. You can drag and drop the element with the mouse, but it's not precise. Hold `SHIFT` while doing this to move it in a straight line. You can go horizontally, vertically, and even diagonally. NOTE: Don't click in the exact center of the element, as this will change certain properties. Click off-center.

## Precise Movements

1. Instead of dragging and dropping, zoom in and use your arrow keys to position the selected element.

## Guideline

To center an element, for example:

1. Select your layer in the layer panel.
2. Click and hold on the left-hand vertical ruler. Drag it onto the canvas and let go. The line will snap to the exact center.
3. Use this centered line as a guideline to move your element into the center using the techniques above. (In fact, the element should snap into the center when it gets close enough.)
