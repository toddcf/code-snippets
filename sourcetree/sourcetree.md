# Sourcetree

Sourcetree is a UI that allows you to use Git without using the command line.


## History

The history tab lets you see all the commits that have been made.


## Viewing File Differences

While the "History" tab is selected, click any commit in the list.  Another panel will show you the changes that were made for that commit.

- Green highlights are additions.
- Red highlights are deletions.


## Searching

Larger projects are too difficult to search through visually.  Use the "Search" tab and type in what you are looking for.  You can also edit the dropdown to filter for the type of search you are doing.  For example, you can search within commit messages, branches, users, etc.

Then, you can click on each search result to see the changes made in each one displayed in the panel below.


## Selecting Projects

The buttons along the top of the Sourcetree UI will let you create a new repository, or locate an existing remote or local repository / working directory.
